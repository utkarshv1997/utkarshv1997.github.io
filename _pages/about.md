Currently, I work as an R&D engineer in the Analytics platform team at *AppDynamics, Cisco Systems, Bangalore, India*. I completed my undergraduate
from *Birla Institue of Technology and Science, Pilani, Pilani Campus* with a major in **Computer Science** and a minor in **Finance**.

> Special introduction for BITSians : (**2015A7PS0130P, SR-240, BD-1133, VY-158, RP-213**).

Through various experiences in my academic and professional career I have developed an interest in **Distributed Systems** and **Big Data** and 
I'm highly intrigued by problems concerning data-intensive workloads on Big-data systems.
I'm a spirited Athlete (a sprinter to be precise) who loves observing patterns for solving problems and strives to be a part of various teams, be it 
technical or organisational, sometimes leading them as well. Various such experiences along with a new-found interest in playing the Flute stem from my 
*undergrad life*.
