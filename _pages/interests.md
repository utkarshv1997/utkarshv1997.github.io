### When I'm not fixing bugs in Production/ working on a project/ reading a paper, you can find me doing some of the following stuff -->   

### Football (Soccer)
I was always interested in Football (Soccer), playing more than following the sport, although it may have stemmed from my abilities as a sprinter, naturally I play on the right wing. <br> 
Juventus used to be my go-to team at the time when *Pirlo* and *Del Piero* used to play but the magic of *Messi* and *Pep Guardiola* took my interests to Barcelona. (Add Man City to the list now!).

### Flute
I picked up playing the Flute in my Junior year during my undergraduate and soon got hooked onto it. *YouTube* is my guru.

### Harry Potter
I'm a huge potter head (I finished reading the entire set four times in Sept, 2020.). Movies have been binge-watched many times.

### YouTube - channels subscribed and watched regularly, some repeatedly :
* Kurzgeagt - In a nutshell (Must try!)
* Data is Beautiful
* MindYourDecisions
* minutephysics
* The Indian Jam Project : (Tushar Lall)
* The Coding Train
* All videos titled : `Memorable moments in Football` :)
