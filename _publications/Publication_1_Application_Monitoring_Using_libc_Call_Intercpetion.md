<b>Abstract:</b> Visual content-based product retrieval has become in-creasingly important for e-commerce. Fashion retrieval, in particular, is a challenging problem owing to a wide range of visual distortions in their product images. In this pa-per, we propose a Grid Search Network (GSN) for learn-ing feature embeddings for fashion retrieval. The proposed approach posits the training procedure as a search prob-lem, focused on locating matches for a reference query im-age in a grid containing both positive and negative images w.r.t the query. The proposed framework signiﬁcantly out-performs existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark fashion datasets. We also utilize a reinforcement learning based strategy to learn a specialized transformation func-tion which further improves retrieval performance when ap-plied over the feature embeddings. We also extend the re-inforcement learning based strategy to learn custom ker-nel functions for SVM based classiﬁcation over FashionM-NIST and MNIST datasets, showing improved performance. We highlight the generalization capabilities of this search strategy by showing performance improvement in domains beyond fashion.
